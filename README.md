# Save-A-Shot
A Vaccination Tracking System
 
## Introduction
Welcome to Save-A-Shot. Save-A-Shot is a program intended to be a all-in-one site for locating and scheduling vaccinations. Vaccinations to what specifically? Well, due to the current state of the United States and its fight against the Coronavirus, there has been a huge amount of confusion and worry amongst the people within our society, about what safety really is. In our case, that means how safe are we from simply wearing masks while everyone goes about their day. Despite wearing being proven to be beneficial in our battle against the virus time and time again, masks can only protect us as much as we follow the strict federal and local state guidelines. Only recently have we gained a great advantage in our fight, as the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna (even Johnson & Johnson now) are gradually becoming more and more available to the public.

With that information, the vaccines are slowly becoming more readily available to the general public, as the State guidelines allow (with more succeptible parties being first in line to take the vaccine). Thus, Save-A-Shot was meant to guide the general public, and give them the oppportunity to view where they can get their turn in taking a vaccine. Using VaccinateCA's application programming interface, we were successfully able to map out nearby locations of an available vaccine, with a simple city search.

## How Did We Accomplish Our Project?
Our program was created mainly with Javascript, Foundation.js., the VaccinateCA application programming interface, and the Open Street Map application programming interface. 

The interface of the program was created with a base format of the Foundation front-end framework. This framework was mentioned in various instances on Online Blog pages and Front-End Reddit pages, as a great alternative to the commonly used Bootstrap. Taking a leap of faith into something we were not familiar with, we decided to utilize this source for our front-end visuals. Nonetheless, the overall interface turned out to be very simple and straightforward which made organization even easier. Along with a bit of advanced CSS techniques with some simple research and sources such as Codepen.io, Gradientmagic.com, w3schools.com, etc., we were able to create the masterpiece that is Save-A-Shot. A very simple and easy-to-navigate interface, yet sophisticated in its organization and application.
